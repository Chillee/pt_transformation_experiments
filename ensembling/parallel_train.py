# Step 7: Now, the flaw with step 6 is that we were training on the same exact
# data. This can lead to all of the models in the ensemble overfitting in the 
# same way. The solution that http://willwhitney.com/parallel-training-jax.html
# applies is to randomly subset the data in a way that the models do not recieve
# exactly the same data in each training step!
# Because the goal of this doc is to show that we can use eager-mode vmap to
# achieve similar things as JAX, the rest of this is left as an exercise to the reader.

# In conclusion, to achieve what http://willwhitney.com/parallel-training-jax.html
# does, we used the following additional items that PyTorch does not have:
# 1. NN module functional API that turns a module into a (state, state_less_fn) pair
# 2. Functional optimizers
# 3. A "functional" grad API (that effectively wraps autograd.grad)
# 4. Composability between the functional grad API and torch.vmap.
